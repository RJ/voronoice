//! # voronoice
//!
//! This crate provides a nice and fast way to construct 2D [Voronoi diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) from a set of sites.
//! It builds Voronoi diagrams by first obtaining its [Delaunay triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation), through the really fast [delaunator](https://docs.rs/delaunator/*/delaunator) crate,
//! and then extracting its dual Voronoi diagram.
//!
//! Both the Voronoi graph and its dual Delaunay graph are exposed through the [Voronoi] type.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//!```rust
//! use voronoice::*;
//!
//! // voronoi sites
//! let sites = vec![
//!     Point { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 }, Point { x: 1.0, y: 0.0 }, Point { x: 0.0, y: 1.0 }
//! ];
//!
//! // builds a voronoi diagram from the set of sites above, bounded by a square of size 4
//! let my_voronoi = VoronoiBuilder::default()
//!     .set_sites(sites)
//!     .set_bounding_box(BoundingBox::new_centered_square(4.0))
//!     .set_lloyd_relaxation_iterations(5)
//!     .build()
//!     .unwrap();
//!
//! // inspect cells through iterators
//! my_voronoi.iter_cells().for_each(|cell| {
//!     println!("Vertices of cell: {:?}", cell.iter_vertices().collect::<Vec<&Point>>())
//! });
//!
//! // or probe cells individually
//! let my_cell = my_voronoi.cell(1);
//! println!("Second cell has site {:?}, voronoi vertices {:?} and delaunay triangles {:?}",
//!     my_cell.site_position(),
//!     my_cell.iter_vertices().collect::<Vec<&Point>>(),
//!     my_cell.iter_triangles().collect::<Vec<usize>>());
//!
//! // or, for graphical applications, that benefit from index buffers
//! // you can access the raw, indexed data
//! let all_voronoi_cell_vertices = my_voronoi.vertices();
//! let indexed_voronoi_cells = my_voronoi.cells();
//! println!("The first vertex position for the first voronoi cell is at {:?}",
//!     all_voronoi_cell_vertices[indexed_voronoi_cells[0][0]]);
//!```
